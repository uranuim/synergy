Audio-Video Intercom System for Deaf Users
Overview
This project is a Machine Learning-based Audio-Video Intercom System specifically designed for deaf users. It enhances traditional intercoms by incorporating sign language recognition, which converts sign language into text for further processing. The system enables effective communication between visitors and users by translating sign language into text and providing text-based responses.

Features
Real-time Sign Language Recognition: Captures and translates sign language gestures into text.
Text-Based Interaction: Converts recognized signs into text, allowing users to read and respond to visitors.
Audio-Video Communication: Supports video communication with visitors, ensuring both parties can see each other.
Smart Notifications: Sends alerts with translated sign language text and video snapshots to your mobile device.
Visitor Log: Maintains a history of interactions, including video and translated text records.
Cloud Integration: Optionally integrates with cloud services for remote access and data storage.
Installation
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8+
OpenCV
TensorFlow or PyTorch (for ML model)
Flask (for the web server)
Twilio API (optional, for SMS notifications)
Raspberry Pi (optional, for hardware setup)
Steps
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/audio-video-intercom-system.git
cd audio-video-intercom-system
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Setup the Environment:

Configure the config.py file with your settings, such as camera source, sign language model, Twilio credentials, etc.
If using a Raspberry Pi, ensure the camera module is enabled.
Train the Sign Language Model:

Use the provided scripts in the models directory to train or fine-tune the sign language recognition model.
Place the trained model in the models directory.
Run the System:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
The system will start and be accessible via the configured IP and port.
Access the Web Interface:

Open your browser and navigate to http://<IP_ADDRESS>:<PORT> to access the intercom system.
Usage
Visitor Interaction:

When a visitor arrives, the system detects motion and begins recording.
If the visitor uses sign language, the system translates the gestures into text in real-time.
The translated text is displayed on the userâ€™s device, allowing them to understand the visitor's message and respond accordingly.
Users can type a response, which can be displayed as text on the screen for the visitor or converted to speech for hearing visitors.
Remote Access:

Access the system remotely through the cloud service (if configured).
Review logs, including video and translated sign language text, or control the system remotely.
